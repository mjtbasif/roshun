# Roshun

This project workspace is designed for learning and practicing various tools and technologies such as Nx, GitHub, Jenkins, Chart, and Cypress. The setup allows for experimentation and understanding of these tools in a comprehensive development environment.

## Objective

The primary objective of this workspace is to:

- **Learn Nx**: Understand how Nx can be used for monorepo management, code sharing, and scaling development workflows.
- **Explore GitHub**: Utilize Git version control, GitHub repositories, and collaborative workflows for effective project management.
- **Implement Jenkins**: Setup continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using Jenkins for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Chart**: Experiment with charting libraries or tools for data visualization and representation.
- **Cypress Testing**: Employ Cypress for end-to-end testing of applications and understand its capabilities in ensuring code reliability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Nx CLI
- Git
- Jenkins
- Chart library/tool of choice
- Cypress
